      <div>
        <p>
          Password expiration policies are in effect in many companies and organizations but they actually *weaken* security since humans can only remember a limited number of passwords and thus often make only a small change to their previous password [2]. This makes passwords easier to crack.

      <header><h2>What should I do about password expiration policies?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          Let your boss, Head of Security, management etc. know that password expiration policies weaken rather than improve security. If you are in a position of power consider removing the password expiration policy (bonus: your users are going to love you for not having to change passwords!). For specific guidelines read NIST's document [2] or one of the summaries [4,5].

      <header><h2>Where do password expiration policies come from?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          An employee at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) gave it as an official recommendation in 2003. He has since regretted the recommendation since password expiration policies actually weaken security. [1]

      <header><h2>Why should I trust NIST when they recommend against password expiration policies?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) were the ones to originally recommend password expiration policies so they are probably the reason your organization has those policies to begin with [1]! If you drop the policies you are still putting your trust in the same place. Other tech leaders such as Microsoft are also moving away from password expiration policies [3] which is an indication that it is the right thing to do.

      <header><h2>What is the purpose of this page?</h2></header>
      <div>
        This page has multiple purposes:
        <ul>
          <li> Spread awareness of the fact that password expiration policies are harmful.</li>
          <li> Provide a compact version of the arguments against password expiration policies. Many similar pages explain the issue in greater detail (see links in Read More) at the risk of turning the reader away.</li>
          <li> The end goal is to liberate every single person everywhere from the frustration of having to needlessly change passwords.</li>
        </ul>
        We can do this better with your input: Are we wrong? Missing some details or important arguments? File an issue on <a href="https://github.com/longlivepasswords/longlivepasswords">GitHub</a>.
