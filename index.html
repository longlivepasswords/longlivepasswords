      <div>
        <p>
          Password expiration actually *weakens* security since humans can only remember a limited number of passwords and thus often make only a small change to their previous password. This makes passwords easier to crack.

      <header><h2>Where do password expiration policies come from?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          An employee at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) gave it as an official recommendation in 2003. He has since regretted since password expiration policies actually *weaken* security. [1]

      <header><h2>What should I do about password expiration policies?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          Let your boss, Head of Security, management etc. know that password expiration policies weaken rather than improve security. If you are in a position of power consider removing the password expiration policy (bonus: your users are going to love you for not having to change passwords!). For specific guidelines read NIST's document [2] or one of the summaries [4,5]

      <header><h2>Why should I trust NIST when they recommend against password expiration policies?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) were the ones to originally recommend password expiration policies so they are probably the reason your organization has those policies to begin with [1]! If you drop the policies you are still putting your trust in the same place. Other tech leaders such as Microsoft are also moving away from password expiration policies [3] which is an indication that it is the right thing to do.

      <header><h2>Who uses password expiration policies?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          Many organizations and companies have expiring passwords as a security policy.

      <header><h2>What is the purpose of this page?</h2></header>
      <div>
        <p>
          This page has multiple purposes:
          - Spread awareness of the fact that password expiration policies are harmful.
          - Provide a compact version of the arguments against password expiration policies. Many similar pages explain the issue in greater detail (see links in Read More inkzzz]) at the risk of turning the reader away.
          - The end goal is to liberate every single person everywhere from the frustration of having to needlessly change passwords.
