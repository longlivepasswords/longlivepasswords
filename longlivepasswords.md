# Why are passwords expired?
An employee NIST gave it as an official recommendation in 2003. He has since regretted since password expiration policies actually *weaken* security. [0]

# Why are password expiration policies bad?
Password expiration actually *weakens* security since humans can only remember a limited number of passwords and thus often make only a small change to their previous password. This makes passwords easier to crack.

# Why should I do about password expiration policies?
Let your boss, Head of Security, management etc. know that password expiration policies weaken rather than improve security. If you are in a position of power consider removing the password expiration policy (bonus: your users are going to love you for not having to change passwords!). For specific guidelines read NIST's document [1] or one of the digests [3,4]


# Why should I trust NIST when they recommend against password expiration policies?
NIST were the ones to originally recommend password expiration policies so they are probably the reason your organization has those policies to begin with [0]! If you drop the policies you are still putting your trust the same place. Other tech leaders such as Microsoft are also moving away from password expiration policies [2]

# Who uses password expiration policies?

- Provide a compact version of the arguments against password expiration policies. Many similar pages explain the issue in greater detail (see links in Read More inkzzz]) at the risk of turning the reader away.
- The end goal is to liberate every single person everywhere from the frustration of having to needlessly change passwords.
